# Overview

# Data Treatment
- [x] Adapt existing code to new data
- [x] Modularize
- [x] Script to run complete trips data treatment
- [x] Add load trips module
- [ ] Stations treatment -> considerar id

# Data analysis

- [x] Get covid data
- [x] Group covid by month
- [x] Group trips data by day and month
- [x] Calculate correlation between bss trips and covid data
- [ ] Plot the evolution of the following variables: 
     - [x] Number of trips
     - [x] Average of trip_duration
     - [x] Age of people
     - [ ] Trip distance
- [ ] Chow test to verify if there is a structural break after COVID
- [ ] Plot evolution in a beautiful way
- [ ] Modularize
     - [ ] Save all plots in a folder
     - [ ] Transform plots to a pdf or latex file
- [ ] Script to run complete trips data analysis and export
- [ ] Plot trips distribution histogram for trip duration and age
     -  [ ] delivery was the cause of trip duration increase? 
- [ ] In plots, make y axis lower limit equal to zero
- [ ] Find flow difference
          - flows that have stayed and flows that are gone after the pandemic
